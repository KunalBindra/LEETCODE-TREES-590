# LEETCODE-TREES-590
To analyze the code, let's break it down into its components and perform a dry run on a specific example.

**Class Structure:**

- `Solution` class: This class contains the logic for performing post-order traversal on a tree.
- `postorder` method:
  - Takes the root node of the tree as input.
  - Returns a list of integers representing the post-order traversal of the tree.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Base case:** If the root node is null, an empty list is returned.
2. **Initialization:**
   - An empty list `ans` is created to store the post-order traversal.
   - A stack is initialized to store nodes.
   - The root node is pushed onto the stack.
3. **Iteration:**
   - While the stack is not empty:
     - Pop the top node from the stack.
     - Add the value of the popped node to the `ans` list.
     - Push all the children of the popped node onto the stack in reverse order (right to left).
4. **Reverse:** Reverse the `ans` list to obtain the correct post-order traversal.
5. **Return:** Return the reversed `ans` list.

**Example:**

Let's consider a tree with the following structure:

```
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \
 4   5
```

**Dry run:**

1. **Initial call:** `postorder(root)` is called with the root node (1).
2. **Base case:** The root is not null, so we proceed.
3. **Initialization:** `ans` is empty, and the stack contains [1].
4. **Iteration:**
   - Pop 1 from the stack, add it to `ans`: [1].
   - Push children 2 and 3 onto the stack: [2, 3].
   - Pop 3 from the stack, add it to `ans`: [1, 3].
   - Push children of 3 (none) onto the stack.
   - Pop 2 from the stack, add it to `ans`: [1, 3, 2].
   - Push children 4 and 5 onto the stack: [4, 5].
   - Pop 5 from the stack, add it to `ans`: [1, 3, 2, 5].
   - Push children of 5 (none) onto the stack.
   - Pop 4 from the stack, add it to `ans`: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4].

5. **Reverse:** Reverse the `ans` list: [4, 5, 2, 3, 1].

6. **Return:** Return the reversed `ans` list.

**Output:**

The post-order traversal of the given tree is [4, 5, 2, 3, 1].

**Conclusion:**

The code effectively implements post-order traversal using a stack. It efficiently traverses the tree, adds nodes to the list in post-order, and then reverses the list to obtain the correct order.
